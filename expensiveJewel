// You go to a jewelry shop and try to find the most expensive piece of jewelry. You write down the name of each piece of jewelry and its price.
// Create a function that gets the name of the piece of jewelry with the highest price and returns "The most expensive one is the {name of jewelry piece}".


// SOLUTION
function mostExpensive(obj) {
    let displayText = 'The most expensive one is the ' 
    const prices = Object.values(obj) 
    
    const sorted = prices.sort(function(a,b){ return b-a}) 
    const highest = sorted[0] 

    const jewel = Object.keys(obj).find(key => obj[key] === highest) 
    return displayText + `${jewel}` 
}

    const jewel = Object.keys(obj).find(key => obj[key] === sorted[0]) 
    return 'The most expensive one is the '  + `${jewel}`
